That's the component that decides where and how to pre-segment the origin string. The simplest example would be to simply split on spaces.\n- **Model**: Handles all the sub-token discovery and generation, this is the part that is trainable and really dependent of your input data.\n- **Post-Processing**: Provides advanced construction features to be compatible with some of the Transformers-based SoTA models. For instance, for BERT it would wrap the tokenized sentence around [CLS] and [SEP] tokens.\n\nAnd to go in the other direction:\n\n- **Decoding**: In charge of mapping back a tokenized input to the original string. The decoder is usually chosen according to the `PreTokenizer` we used previously.\n\nFor the training of the model, the 🤗 Tokenizers library provides a `Trainer` class that we will use.\n\nAll of these building blocks can be combined to create working tokenization pipelines.
